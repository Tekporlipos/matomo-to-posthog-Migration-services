"georgeboateng93@gmail.com","2023-05-25 22:17:07","Ask Kwame Page","User Query","Dear Legal Kwame, I am writing to seek your legal advice concerning a business venture that I started with Richard Mensah. Richard approached me with a business proposal where I was to help him brand his new company, Richinvestment Ghana, which is solely into selling household appliances, in return for 10% shares. As we worked towards developing the new business, Richard introduced another business idea, which is Travels. We had to rebrand the company to RiGafrica, with RIG standing for Rich Investment Ghana. The RiGafrica became the mother company with two subsidiaries, which are Rigbuy and Rigtravels, for the appliance and travels businesses respectively. We worked tirelessly for seven months before officially starting operations in January 2023. Last month, during a management meeting, Richard split my 10% shares into 5% each at Rigbuy and Rigtravels, which did not sit well with me. Firstly, he did not discuss the split with me before taking the decision, and secondly, the 10% agreement we had was only for the household appliance business, not the travels business. I confronted him, and we had a meeting where he agreed to give me the 10% shares at Rigbuy. However, he later informed me that he could not give me the 10% shares at Rigbuy and that he would prepare an agreement on it. Today, I sent in my resignation letter, stating that I am no longer interested in his shares. I also plan to serve him a letter concerning my intellectual property, which includes the logos and graphics I built for the company during the seven months of operation. I want to propose an amount for the company to buy or stop using everything I built. I am seeking your legal advice on the best way to handle this situation and protect my intellectual property. Thank you for your assistance.",NULL
