Kay joined the company in 2012 after he had obtained an MSC in Computer Science from the University of Ghana. Before joining Edutech, Kay had been self-employed and was dealing in soap production with his wife, Naana. When Kay joined Edutech, he got to know of the three-tier pension system in Ghana at a staff orientation and he was immediately registered with the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT). When Kay received his first pay slips, he noticed that he had contributed 5.5% of his salary to his pension and his employer had also contributed 13% of his salary to same. Kay also noticed that out of the total contribution of 18.5%, 7% had been transferred to the second tier occupational pension scheme managed by 419 Trustees. When Kay questioned Ebo Smart (Ebo), the Finance Manager at Edutech about the status of 419 Trustees, Ebo assured him that the company is duly licensed by the National Insurance Commission as a private corporate trustee. Kay also noticed that 3% of the total contribution had been transferred to a privately managed provident fund he knew nothing about, but which Ebo informs him is mandatory for all workers in Ghana. Edutech Solutions has received a letter from SSNIT, inviting them to a meeting to discuss some &#039;discrepancies&#039; in the company&#039;s employees&#039; pension contributions. The company has come to you as an expert in financial services regulation for advice before they attend the meeting. Identify and resolve the legal issues and advise Edutech and Kay.",NULL

Amped was the owner of the famous Ohene Nana Villa in Mpreaso Kwahu which is subject to a mortgage at the Kwaku Mpreaso Bank. Ampedu had three sons and a daughter. On 25th October, 2010, Ampedu executed his last will and testament and made the following dispositions:
* ﻿﻿﻿&quot;I appoint Paabobo, as my executor. I direct my executor to forgive my son Koo Nimo the amount GH¢ 50,000 I loaned him.
* ﻿﻿﻿&quot;I also direct my executor to forgive my son, Ambuley the GH$ 75,000 he borrowed from me to start his water bottling business.
* ﻿﻿﻿&quot;I bequeath all my 100,000 shares from Talbolt Oil to my daughter Kyeiwaa and devise to my son Nkasei my property known as Ohene Nana Villa for his own absolute use and benefit subject to the mortgage of GH¢25,000 secured on it&quot;
* ﻿﻿﻿Ampedu devised all his other immovable properties except the Villa to &quot;my wife Getty and my children to take in equal shares&quot;
* ﻿﻿﻿He further bequeaths all his personal items and effects to his niece Serwah, Akoto and also appointed her as the residuary beneficiary.
* ﻿﻿﻿In 2009, Ampedu took a life policy from Glenco Insurance on his life for GH$ 1,000,000 and nominated his wife as the beneficiary.
* ﻿﻿﻿An avid collector of stamps, Ampedu insured his Vintage Stamps collection for $15,000 against theft and fire and bequeathed the collections to his daughter, Keiwaa.
* ﻿﻿﻿The will was duly executed in accordance with the Wills Act, Act 360.
* ﻿﻿﻿On 13th November, 2011 Ampedu entered into a contract to sell Ohene Nana Villa to Nkasei for GH$ 30,000 undertaking not to encumber the Villa to any extent further. Nkasei on his part undertook to pay the purchase price, the loan of GH¢ 25,000 and agreed that he gets title to the Villa only when the property is freed from the mortgage secured thereon.
* ﻿﻿﻿Ampedu executed a codicil in December, 2011 confirming his 2010 will.
* ﻿﻿﻿On 14th January, 2012 Ampedu inserted a provision next to the bequest to Kveiwaa directing his executor as follows: &quot;I hereby direct my executor to pay to my only daughter the proceeds of the sale of the Villa and any interest thereof to be deposited in my high interest yielding account at Kwahu Mpreaso Bank. Ampedu then initialled his names beside the disposition and dated it.
* 1) By a codicil dated 20th January, 2012,, Ampedu directed that a collection of over 1000 songs and lyrics which he is about to compile titled &quot;The Greatest Hits of Ohene Ampedu: King of Afro Beats&quot; should be donated to the Kwahu College of Arts and Traditional Studies if they are completed upon his death.

* ﻿﻿﻿Ampedu deposited a copy of his will with his lawyer friend Agyekum and the other at the High Court on 14th February, 2012.
* ﻿﻿﻿On 23rd December, 2013 Ampedu thinking that upon his death his wife and children will inherit his entire estate wrote to Lawyer Agyekum directing him to destroy his 2010 will and the subsequent codicils to thereto.
* On 19th January, 2015 Ampedu executed a codicil appointing Getty as his sole executor and provided as follows &quot;I made a will previously in 2010; this is my last effort to put my affairs in order; everything in my 2010 will and codicils thereto remain unchanged.&quot;
* The 2015 codicil did not make any reference to Ohene Nana Villa.
* Ohene Ampedu passed away on January 30th, 2015, Getty and Nkasei disagree on the status of the gift of Ohene Nana Villa to Nkasei among others.   
* Using relevant case law and the Wills Act, Act 360, write a legal opinion advising Getty on the various issues prompted by Ampedu&#039;s will.",NULL
